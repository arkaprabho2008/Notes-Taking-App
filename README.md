# Notes-Taking-App
This is my notes taking app using pure JavaScript and node.js as backend


I didn't thought of making this ever . 

But recently two days ago , I was just sitting alone , and suddenly I thought of building this project , and from then onwards , I started working on this . 
It required two hours two be complete . And I have done numerous styling on it . 


And the login is completely written using Vanilla JavaScript 

And the backend is done using node.js and express.js
